New changes to the MyAdmin SDK.

## December 5th, 2022

### Updates

#### DeviceContractTransactions

- When calling GetDeviceContractTransactions, you will now see a new property in the returned DeviceContractTransactions object: int `UserContactId`
- If null, `UserContactId` will return -1
- Else, it will return the unique ID that belongs to the user contact
- This ID can be leveraged alongside GetUserContacts to return all the contact details of the user contact (currently DeviceContractTransactions only returns `UserContactName`)

#### ForceChangePasswordForUsersAsync

- The ForceChangePasswordForUsersAsync method now allows you to toggle on Force Password Change for user accounts so that you can decide how often users are resetting their passwords
- The ForceChangePasswordForUsersAysync requires the `apikey`, `sessionID`, and a list of usernames `userNames`, and you must toggle `forceChangePassword` to True or False.


### Coming Soon

#### EditUserContact

-In an upcoming release, we will update the EditUserContact method logic to validate provided addresses, and provide the option to override invalid addresses, if the user has the Contact-Override role.

### Updates

#### PartnerDeviceContractsAsync

- A new API, GetPartnerDeviceContractsAsync, has been added to allow Marketplace Partners and Integration Partners to retrieve a list of active devices theyâ€™ve produced, as well as the database each device is connected to.
- With this API, these Partners can set up, service, and support their products, as well as ensure their products are properly functioning. 
- The ThirdPartyPartner-Admin role is required to access the GetPartnerDeviceContractsAsync API. 
-  To use this API, input `sessionID` in addition to the GetPartnerDeviceContractsAsync method. Once this is complete, the API call retrieves the list of devices including the Serial Number, Database, and Product Code. 
- This API is for Partners who produce third-party products only.
